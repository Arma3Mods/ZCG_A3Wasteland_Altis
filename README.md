*A3Wasteland.Altis* by ZCG!
===================

ArmA 3 Wasteland is a harsh survival sandbox mission where 2 teams and independent players fight for survival.


The mission is not ready yet, so for now it's just a placeholder :)

All development is done in the <a href="https://github.com/Panaetius/ZCG_A3Wasteland_Altis/tree/master">`master`</a> branch.

Installation
============

- Follow the instructions to install <a href="http://arma2netmysqlplugin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">`Arma2NETMySql</a>
- Use the setup_db.sql in the DatabaseSetup folder to set up your MySQL Database
If you only want base saving to activate before a server restart (for performance reasons), use the batch files in the DatabaseSetup to set the "DoSave" flag to one before a restart (scheduled task or BEC command is fine) and set it back to 0 right before the restart
- Use the BinPBO tools and the make_pbo.bat file (you need to edit this file) to compile the mission PBO file
- Deploy the PBO on your server
